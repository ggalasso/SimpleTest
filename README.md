# SimpleTest
This started out as a project that was intended to design the Simple XML Framework. Needless to say it has outlived this intent and has moved on to bigger and better things. To date it is intended to help BGG members view their board game collections and manage play scenarios / statistics that would otherwise not be available to them.

It is android based and will provide disconnected scenarios.
